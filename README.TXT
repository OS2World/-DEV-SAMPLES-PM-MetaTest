This program is the star5.c program from Petzold that has had code added to
create a meta (.MET) file that can be viewed by the PM picture viewer.

The added code came from the Microsoft OS/2 Programmers Reference Vol 2.
(pages 449 - 459). It creates a metafile of a different image than that on
the screen. The metafile is created as soon as the program starts.
